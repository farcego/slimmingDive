* DONE Data pre-processing [100%]
  CLOSED: [2019-11-21 Thu 12:35]
  I have found some data files with duplicated rows and not being
  ordered by date. Proposed changes:
- [X]  order by date
   something like fo[order(fo$Date), ]
- [X] remove duplicated entries
   something like fo[!duplicated(fo), ]
- [X] Fix the problem with variable cases
  for certain datasets provided by SMRU, some relevant fields like
  latitude or longitude may appear either in lower or upper cases.
