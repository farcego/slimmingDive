Description: Package slimingDive contains a set of functions for detect and filter drift dives from elephant seal dive profiles summarized by a broken-stick algorithm. These functions are prepared to work with the general format provided by SMRU tags. It has been developed with High-Resolution Time-Depth profiles and tested with Satellite transmitted  Profiles provided by the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS).
